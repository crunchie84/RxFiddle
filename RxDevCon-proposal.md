# About yourself
MSc student from Delft, Netherlands. Subject: Rx Debugging, supervisor: Erik Meijer. Experience with Rx since 2013. Fell in love and have used it in most projects since then. Currently creating a visualizer which attaches to running Rx programs (either in a web-browser or a JVM) and shows what is going on. Plan is to have this visualizer / debugger completed in April 2017, which should provide a very nice starting point for a presentation!

# Will you require travel assistance? 
Depends on the distance to be traveled. Flying to the USA would be expensive from Europe for me, so all help is welcome!

# Track
Cross library: I'm focussing on both RxJS and Rx for the JVM (RxScala & RxJava)

# Title
Visualizing Observables and their events

# Description
When building an application using Rx the Observable chain can become rather large. 
To better debug and understand the thing you (or your colleague) created, you would 
want to see the data flow. The structure, the subscriptions and events should be 
tracked. Virtual Time could be leveraged to re-run the execution, or to extract a test 
case from the actual input events. This is the story about the need for, the 
creation of, and using a Reactive Extensions debugger.
